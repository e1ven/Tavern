Developing using Tavern
=======================

The internet was build to be open
---
The internet was built around the open exchange of ideas and information. Universities and research institutions embraced open systems, working together to create the core of almost everything we do online - Reading webpages in HTML, sending emails with SMTP, or chatting with friends XMPP - These open protocols and specificiations allow anyone to write programs which are part of a larger world. These open protocols can last longer than any single company, organization or creator, and make it easy for software from multiple groups to work together to share data and ideas.

Open protocols gives users a choice - We can choose read our mail through Outlook, Thunderbird, Mailbox or Sparrow, or we can browse the web in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer or Opera. Each solution was developed by separate groups, but they work together using open protocols to share data, exchange files, and let users choose solutions that works for them.


Tavern is an Open, Distributed, way to build your apps
---
Tavern is open in the broadest sense of the term - Like other core internet protocols, no single company controls the Tavern Protocol, and no one can shut it down.
It lets you build applications which share data with the world, without having to ask anyone for permission or forgiveness.

In the past, various companies have opened their APIs to the public, encouraging us to write clients, or to integrate into our applications - They often do so from a genuine desire to help, and to see their network become ubiquitous. But despite whatever benevolence they may have begun with, eventually market conditions force a change.

They may begin adding additional rules for how your client works, or how many users you can have. Soon, developers often find that they can only release applications that the company approves of, regardless of how that effects your business.

Tavern is fundementally different. Tavern is a messaging protocol where you don't specify the recipients - Your message is shared with anyone who wants it.
Tavern has no central authority to tell you what you can post, and how you should display it. Each client, each Developer, can make their own choices about what Tavern is, and how it can work best for them.



Tavern is what you make it
