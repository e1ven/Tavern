How does Tavern Work?
*********************

Tavern is a Decentralized, Anonymous, Peer to Peer forum, written in
Tornado and Python3. It is designed to be censorship resistant, and is
based on the idea of passing signed messages. Each message is a JSON
document, signed by a Public Key that is unique to each user. We then
pass these along to various servers, and organize them by Topics.
