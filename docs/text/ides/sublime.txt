Using Sublime
*************

No particular IDE is necessary for Tavern, but I've included a Sublime
Text config file. I've played with a few IDEs (Pycharm, Textmate,
TextPad, Subl), and currently prefer Sublime. If you have another IDE
you prefer, feel free to contribute it's confs.

I am personally using the following plugins-

   https://github.com/int3h/SublimeFixMacPath
      This allows tavern.sh to run and see your bash path.

   https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Jedi%20-%20Python%20autocomplet
   ion
      This is an autocomplete library.
