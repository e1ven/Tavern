### What is Tavern?

Tavern is a decentralized and anonymous way to exchange ideas and information with the world.

It's designed to be censor-resistant, and by sharing encrypted and signed messages with other users running the software.

### What Tavern is not:

Tavern is not a finished program, or ready to be used outside of development

**You should not trust Tavern to keep you safe.**

Tavern is still being written, and should not be used to protect or hide dangerous information or communications.

While Tavern aims to provide resilience to censorship, it is trivial to determine if a machine is running Tavern.

Never trust any software with your life or safety.

### How to Install:

The easiest way to run Tavern is to start the Vagrant instance included inside.
See docs/Using-Vagrant for instructions.

Alternatively, You can install Tavern locally onto your machine.
If you are on Ubuntu 13.10 or OSX, the script `install.sh` should walk you through the install.

Once the installation is complete, you can start tavern by running 

`tavern.sh start` to start in the background 
or 
`tavern.sh debug` to run without forking


### Documentation

Tavern is a Decentralized, Anonymous, Peer to Peer forum, written in Tornado and Python3.
It is designed to be censorship resistant, and is based on the idea of passing signed messages.

There is a Specification for messages in the "Spec" directory, but the basic format is very simple.
Each message is a JSON document, signed by a RSA Public Key that is unique to each user.

We then pass these along to various servers, and organize them by Topics.




The easiest way to get running quickly is to use Vagrant. This will run Tavern in a VM.
There is a guide to using Tavern with Vagrant in docs/Using-Vagrant
