PyCharm is kinda neat, but it's a PITA about working with the workflow that I prefer.
I do -not- want a top-level .idea folder. 

I'd prefer to keep all IDE information in Tavern/datafiles/ide

I haven't figured out a good way to make PyCharm happy, but I've hacked it for now.
If you'd like to do more, go for it! ;)

To open Tavern in PyCharm, from this folder, run:

ln -Fs `pwd`/PyCharm  `pwd`/../../.idea

This is symlink the .idea folder to the location where PyCharm would prefer it.
Then, open Pycharm, and Open Folder, and select your Tavern install folder.

I have also installed the Bash Plugin (http://www.ansorg-it.com/en/products_bashsupport.html)
