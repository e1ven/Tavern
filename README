Tavern is a Decentralized, Anonymous, Peer to Peer forum, written in Tornado and Python3.
It is designed to be censorship resistant, and is based on the idea of passing signed messages.

There is a Specification for messages in the "Spec" directory, but the basic format is very simple.
Each message is a JSON document, signed by a RSA Public Key that is unique to each user.

We then pass these along to various servers, and organize them by Topics.




The easiest way to get running quickly is to use Vagrant. This will run Tavern in a VM.
There is a guide to using Tavern with Vagrant in docs/Using-Vagrant

To install Tavern to a system for production use, follow the guide in docs/INSTALL

The main web-interface runs in "webfront.py"
The API runs in "api.py"
You can start the server with "tavern.sh start"

Tavern is written in Python3 and Tornado.
